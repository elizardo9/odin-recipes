        <h2>Description.</h2>
        <p>
            Guandules (Cajanus cajan) – known in English as pigeon peas – are a type of legume native to the Indian subcontinent and very popular in the Spanish Caribbean.
            <br>
            The taste of guandules has been variously described to me as "nutty" or "ashy". I would describe the taste more as "smoky". The closest to legume I can think of in terms of taste is mung beans.
            <br>
            Guandules are also popular in South India
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon chopped cilantro, (or parsley)</li>
            <li>¼ cup chopped celery</li>
            <li>⅛ cup capers, (optional)</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon mashed garlic</li>
            <li>12 pitted green olives, cut into halves (optional)</li>
            <li>¼ cup chopped cubanelle, (1 pepper, aprox)</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
            <li>3 cup pigeon peas, (boiled or canned)</li>
            <li>½ cup tomato sauce</li>
            <li>2 cup coconut milk, or broth or water</li>
            <li>4 cup rice, (medium grain, carolina, canilla)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a 1½ gallon [6 liters] iron pot and add the cilantro, celery, capers, garlic, olives, peppers, oregano, and salt.
            Cook and stir for a minute. Add the guandules, also while stirring.</li>
            <li>Once the vegetables are well heated, add 2 cups of water, tomato sauce, and coconut milk and bring to a boil.
            Stir in rice and simmer over medium heat, stirring regularly, and removing as much as you can of the rice that sticks to the bottom.
            When all the water has evaporated cover with a tight-fitting lid and simmer over very low heat. Wait 15 minutes, uncover, and stir in the remaining oil. Move the rice from the bottom to the top so it cooks uniformly. Cover again and simmer another 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Uncover and taste. The rice should be firm but tender inside. If necessary, cover and leave another 5 minutes on very low heat.</li>
            <li>Serve</li>
        </ol>
